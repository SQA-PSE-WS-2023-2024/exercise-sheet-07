# About
This repository contains the classes needed for solving PSE WS 22/23 excercise sheet 7.

The sheet has a presence and a homework part.

In the presence part you work with mutable and immutable objects.
In the homework part you work with primitives and exceptions.

The code should be solved in the specific classes.
In the presence part you have to use the class you created and in the homework part you have to use the `LazyHamsterGameApp`-class to run your code.

# Run the project

* Open and run in IntelliJ
* Open and run in VSCode
* Unsupported: Run via Maven:
  ```sh

  and you have to add your class to the `pom.xml`-file and run it similar to the `LazyHamsterGameApp`.
